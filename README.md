# Disaster-tweets-prediction-using-TF-IDF-algorithm
# Overview:
This particular challenge is perfect for data scientists looking to get started with Natural Language Processing. The competition dataset is not too big, and even if you don’t have much personal computing power, you can do all of the work in our free, no-setup, Jupyter Notebooks environment called Kaggle Notebooks.

# Competition Description:
Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency.
The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they’re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies).

# Solution:
Cleaned the data and then done some feature engineering like train_test_split.
Solved Using TF-IDF Algorithm from NLP to get the information from the tweets (text data). 
Used Random Forest classifier to get the test Accuracy of 78%.
